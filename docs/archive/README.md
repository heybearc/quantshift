# Archived Files

These files have been consolidated into IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md per D-022 (single implementation plan standard).

## Planning Documents (Archived 2026-02-02)
- **ROADMAP.md** - Consolidated into IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
- **CLEANUP-AUDIT-2026-01-25.md** - Historical cleanup audit (completed)
- **CLEANUP-COMPLETE-2026-01-25.md** - Historical cleanup summary (completed)
- **RELEASE-NOTES-STANDARDIZATION-ANALYSIS.md** - Historical analysis (decision made, implemented)
- **PHASE1_USAGE_GUIDE.md** - Phase 1 implementation guide (completed, features live)
- **PHASE2_USAGE_GUIDE.md** - Phase 2 implementation guide (completed, features live)

## Rationale
D-022 establishes IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md as the single source of truth for:
- Active work items
- Backlog
- Known bugs
- User feedback
- Roadmap/planning

Historical analysis documents and completed phase guides are preserved here for reference but no longer actively maintained.
