## 🔒 Security & Stability Improvements

### Session Management Enhancement

We've implemented industry-standard session management to improve security and system performance.

**What changed:**

- Each user can now have a maximum of 3 active sessions at a time
- When you log in on a 4th device, your oldest session is automatically logged out
- This prevents session buildup and improves system security

**What you need to know:**

- You won't notice any difference in normal usage
- If you use multiple devices, you may be logged out of older sessions automatically
- This is a security best practice used by major platforms
