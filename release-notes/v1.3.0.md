## ✨ New Features

### Environment Indicator
You'll now see a small colored dot in the bottom left corner of the application that shows which server environment you're currently using.

**What you'll see:**
- 🟢 **Green dot** = Production (LIVE) environment
- 🔵 **Blue dot** = Staging (STANDBY) environment

**How to use it:**
1. Look at the bottom left corner of the navigation sidebar

3. The tooltip shows: Server name, Status (LIVE/STANDBY), Container number, and IP address

**Why this matters:**
- Helps you know which environment you're working in
