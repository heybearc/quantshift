## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Environment Indicator Status Detection
Fixed an issue where the LIVE/STANDBY environment indicator would show incorrect status after a traffic switch or container restart.

**What was wrong:**
- After switching traffic between environments, the indicator dots would sometimes show the opposite status
- Green container (LIVE) might show as STANDBY
- Blue container (STANDBY) might show as LIVE

**What's fixed:**
- The indicator now correctly detects and displays the current environment status
- Status updates properly after traffic switches
- Both containers show accurate LIVE/STANDBY status at all times

**What you'll see:**
- The colored dot in the navigation footer now always shows the correct status
- Green dot with "LIVE" when you're on the production environment
- Blue dot with "STANDBY" when you're on the backup environment
