## 🔒 Access Control Improvements

### Registration Temporarily Disabled

We've temporarily disabled public registration while we prepare for our official launch.

**What this means for you:**
- Existing users can continue to log in and use the platform normally
- New users will see a "Coming Soon" message on the registration page
- If you need access now, contact your system administrator

**Why we did this:**
- Ensures a controlled, high-quality launch experience
- Allows us to onboard users properly with support
- Maintains platform stability during beta phase
