## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Environment Indicator Display
The LIVE/STANDBY environment indicator now correctly displays the container color you're viewing:
- **Blue container** shows a blue dot
- **Green container** shows a green dot
- Status (LIVE/STANDBY) is indicated by brightness and emoji

**What this means for you:**
You can now instantly see which container you're on by the color of the indicator dot in the navigation footer.
