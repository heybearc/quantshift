## Features

### Hot-Standby Infrastructure
- Configured LXC 101 as hot-standby for equity bot

- True failover capability for uninterrupted trading operations

### Governance System
- Deployed Cloudy-Work submodule for shared governance
- Workflow distribution system via submodule and symlinks
- Control plane governance files accessible on all containers

- End-day workflow (`/end-day`) for context cleanup
- Governance sync workflow (`/sync-governance`) for updates

## Improvements
